 Mozilla Firefox has a huge amount of spyware features, but they all can be disabled by using predefined profile settings. To do this you need to create new Firefox profile:

    Run firefox -no-remote -ProfileManager
    Create a new profile
    Exit.
Delete everything from the new profile and add user.js
